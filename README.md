# Mistral 7B Instruction Fine-Tuned Chatbot Streamlit Application

This project focuses on fine-tuning Mistral 7B, a highly efficient and powerful language model, on the Alpaca dataset, which is designed for instruction-based conversational tasks. The result is a high-quality chatbot capable of providing coherent, context-aware, and human-like responses tailored for various use cases such as Q&A, customer support, educational tools, and more.

# Key Features:
1) Model Architecture: Based on Mistral 7B, an optimized variant of LLaMA2, this model is compact yet offers excellent performance for diverse NLP tasks.
2) Fine-Tuned on Instruction Data: Utilized the Alpaca dataset, known for its high-quality instruction-response pairs, ensuring that the model excels in understanding and generating responses to user instructions.
3) Scalable Deployment: Integrated with a Streamlit-based web app for easy interaction and demonstration. The model is also uploaded to the Hugging Face Hub for seamless access.
4) Inference-Optimized: Supports CPU-based inference, making it accessible for systems without GPUs. Configuration allows multi-threading for improved speed.

# Project Highlights:
1) Training and Fine-Tuning:
Dataset: The Alpaca dataset with instruction-following pairs.
Tech Stack: Hugging Faceâ€™s transformers library, PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning), and PyTorch.
Hardware: Optimized for CPU and memory-constrained environments, enabling broader accessibility.
2) Deployment:
Web App: Built using Streamlit for an intuitive user experience.
Model Hosting: Available on Hugging Face Hub at ItzShahzaib/mistral-finetuned-alpaca.
3) API Integration: Can be easily integrated into larger systems or products requiring conversational AI.
4) Performance:
Instruction Adherence: Delivers accurate and contextually appropriate responses to user prompts.
Efficiency: Optimized inference for practical applications, ensuring reasonable response times even on CPUs.
